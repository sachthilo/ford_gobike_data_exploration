# Ford GoBike Data Exploration

## Introduction
This collection of data covers individual bike rides within the bike-sharing system operating across the San Francisco Bay Area.

We try to find insight into the following details from the bike rental dataset.

1. Relationships related to rental duration 
2. How does Gender/Age play a role in the rentals 
3. Which start points/end points are more popular 
4. Changes to rental patterns according to Customers or subscribers

In Part 1 we try to conduct an exploratory analysis of the dataset and find out interesting patterns and information.
